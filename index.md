## HelloWorld!

This is the only virtual space where I will share some ideas and opinions about software engineering,
cyber-security (and philosophy maybe)!

Why a repo called _helloworld_ ? A lack of imagination or some sort of nostalgia when I remember the first program I wrote ^^'

### Engineering school projects

Some of INSA projects:

 - [INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Raspberry-OS) is an implementation of a basic OS for RaspberryPi.
 - [INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Prolog-Abalone) is an implementation of Abalone game in Prolog with an AI.
 - [INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter](https://github.com/koromodako/INSA-4IF-Lutin-Interpreter) is an implementation of a basic language interpreter.

Some of UCD projects:

 - [UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-AI-Yavalath) is an implementation of Yavalath game with an IA.
 - [UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI](https://github.com/koromodako/UCD-5IF-PACC-MatrixMultOpenMPI) is an implementation of matrix multiplication using OpenMPI.

### Creations

The Qt-based program called [Picsou](https://github.com/koromodako/picsou) helps keep track of expenses.
It's not beautiful and but it's useful.


[mkCTF](https://github.com/koromodako/mkctf) is framework to enable efficient team work when preparing challenges for a CTF.


[Datashark](https://github.com/koromodako/datashark) is an evolution of the [PoC](https://github.com/koromodako/datashark-poc).
It was designed to automatise the extraction of valuable information from any file whose type is known or has already been reversed. Work is in progress and I do not have a lot of free time to spend on this at the moment.

### Contributions

Contributing to INShAck Capture The Flag by making challenges for people around the world is a great hobby.
Here are the repositories for past editions:

 - [INS'hAck 2019](https://ctftime.org/event/763)
 - [INS'hAck 2018](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2018)
 - [INS'hAck 2017](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2017)
 - [INS'hAck 2016](https://github.com/InsecurityAsso/inshack-2016)


[MapIF](https://github.com/LoicTouzard/mapif) is a website created to keep track of engineering school friends after we
graduated. Precision is voluntarily limited to the city level to preserve privacy.

### Interesting Projects

Here, you will find a non-exhaustive list of projects/organisation that I really appreciate.

 - [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) and [The Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
   because **sharing knowledge is vital**!
 - [SignalSpam](https://www.signal-spam.fr/) because **everyone can fight spam**.
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/) because **simplicity** feels good.
 - [C++](https://isocpp.org/) because **complicated** can be useful.
 - [Root-Me](https://root-me.org) and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) because **hacking requires creativity
   and determination**.
 - [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/) and [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) because **documenting
   is not an option** (even if it can be tough sometimes).
 - [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/) because **privacy should not be neglected**.
 - [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) and [Qwant](https://qwant.com/) because **browsing is money** and **trackers
   are everywhere**.
 - [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) because **ads are plaguing the Internet** (_an ad is not the only way to
   make money in this world_).
 - [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) because **I just want to know if something bad happens**.
 - [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) because this is **the best place to chat at the time of writing**.
 - [OpenAPIv3](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) because **boring tasks are meant to be automated**.

And [many others](https://github.com/koromodako?tab=stars).
